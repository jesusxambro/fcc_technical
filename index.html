        <h3>Computer Science Bachelor's Degree</h3>

        <p>
          Our program offers a bachelor of science in the field of computer
          science. A concentration in computer science will familiarize students
          with the various areas of knowledge that make up the field. Students
          will develop a firm understanding of the fundamental skills and core
          theories that will endure the rapid technological change we experience
          daily. A bachelor of science in computer science, more importantly,
          prepares a student for graduate studies in computer science or in
          other fields that are strongly associated with computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before registering for the first time, the student should discuss an
          appropriate course of study with their advisor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each student that is accepted for the computer science bachelor's
          degree will be assessed. The process begins in CSC 305 Entrance
          Assessment, which must be taken the first semester of enrollment as a
          computer science major. The process concludes in CSC 405 Exit
          Assessment, which must be taken the final semester before graduation.
          This assessment is not used as an assessment of the student, but an
          assessment of our program.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core curriculum provides a strong foundation in computer science.
          CSC electives are chosen in consultation with the student’s adviser to
          ensure depth of knowledge in topics of particular interest to the
          student. CSC courses must be taken for a letter grade.
        </p>

        <p>
          While degree requirements evolve on a regular basis, students are
          allowed a degree of flexibility when determining their specific
          requirements. By default, students are held to the degree requirements
          specified at the time of enrollment. However, students may elect to
          hold themselves to a more recent set of requirements. Students are
          encouraged to retain the appropriate requirement-set and use it to
          monitor their academic progress.
